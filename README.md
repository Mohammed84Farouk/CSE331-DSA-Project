This application is made to deal with xml files and do some operations on them
In the following we will discuss what is the functions that this application can provide for you
•	First of all use load button to load the xml file you want to deal with
•	There are many buttons: Validate, Prettify, Compress, Decompress, Minify, Json, Graph, Most Influencer, Most Active, Mutual followers, Suggest followers and Search Post
•	To check Consistency of xml use Validate Button you have to put file in same folder of exe and pass the file name to Consistency function and another file for the function to save output at (can be same file but I did it like this so we can see the difference) the function does fix the code then it pass the output of the function to the prettify function to make the code readable and easily to be figured out the output of the consistency function is a valid XML but some of the original data in the original XML might get lost 
•	To get a pretty XML use Prettify button (note that prettify used is according to own preference due to using HTML before and it can be changed the main target was to make the code look simplified, easy to read and aligned)
•	To use minify click the minify button then the minified file will appear in the output place
	o	Minify is used to rewrite the file with no spaces or new lines
•	To convert your XML file to readable JSON format click Json button then the output will appear in the output place
•	To compress the file click Compress button then the output file will appear in the same directory of your input file
	o	Used to decrease the size of the file for the sake of sharing for example
•	To decompress the file click Decompress button then the output file will appear in the same directory of your input file
	o	Used to retrieve the original file
•	Finally, we will represent our data in the form of a graph use Graph button, in order to: 
	o	get the most influencing user use Most Influencer button
	o	get the most active user use Most Active button
	o	get mutual followers between two users use Mutual followers button
	o	suggest some followers to a user use Suggest followers button
	o	search on posts with common word using Search Post button
	o	know which user has the highest betweenness centrality use Betweenness button
