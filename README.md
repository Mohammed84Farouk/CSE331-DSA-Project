## Prerequisites

Before building and running this project, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

- Qt 7.0.0
- A C++ compiler (e.g. GCC, MSVC, or Clang)
- Qt Creator or any IDE you like (Make sure to check the comments in the root ``CMakeLists.txt`` file for any outdated configurations such as Qt version)
- CMake 3.23.1

## Features

- Compressing and Decompressing files
- Validating XML files for errors and try a way for fixing them
- Minifying and Preitifying XML files
- Converting XML files to JSON format
- Representing XML files using GRAPH data structure (SNA)

## Building the project

Here are the steps to build and run the project (for windows only, we didn't run the project on any other platform):

1. Download and install qt creator
2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohammed84Farouk/CSE331-DSA-Project.git
```
3. If you are using Qt Creator: select ``File -> Open File or Project`` or on keyboard ``Ctrl+o``
4. Select root ``CMakeLists.txt`` file
5. Press configure project button on the right
6. Run the project
7. If you are not using Qt Creator: have a look at the root ``CMakeLists.txt`` file and uncomment the lines needed.
8. Create a build directory for CMake output
```bash
mkdir .build
```
9. Go inside
```bash
cd .build
```
10. Produce the ``Makefile`` file needed
```bash
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
```
11. Build the project (if that doesn't work for you, just find out the correct naming of make excutable, for me it's ``mingw32-make``)
```bash
make
```
12. Run the project
```bash
./xmlparser.exe
```
13. Any update you make in the source files just repeat steps 10 - 12
